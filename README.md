# Problem Set 01

This repository contains practice exercises for the _Client-Side Web Development_ course at the UW iSchool.

To complete this problem set, follow the instructions in the `README.md` file for each problem.

## Checking Your Work
This exercise comes with a suite of _unit tests_ that you can use to check your work and understanding. Tests are **not** guaranteed to be comprehensive.

In order to run these tests, you will need to install the test dependencies listed in the `package.json` file:

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install
```

You run the tests by using the [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) test runner. You can install this package globally, or you can can run it through `npx`. _Be sure to run the tests from the repo's root directory_.

```bash
# Example: run tests for problem-a
npx jest problem-a

# Run tests for all problems
npx jest
```
